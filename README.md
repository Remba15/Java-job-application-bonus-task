• create SQL database schema and tables to store information from .csv files 
  o create database structure that you think is best to store original data from CSV files (not final
  reports) 
  
• make Java application to scan csv files and import data into database tables
  o Java application can be console application (to be executed on command line)
  o or desktop application (based on Java Swing or Java FX)
  o or web application (in this case, CSV folder and HTML report are on web server) 
  
• make this Java application to print same statistics, but using data from database tables and using SQL
queries to read/analyse/aggregate data 
  o instead of printing statistics to stdout you should create HTML report file in same folder 
  where are original CVS files
